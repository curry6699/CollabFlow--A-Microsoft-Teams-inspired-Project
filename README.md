In UNSW's attempt to try and add a lighter note to the generally fatigued and cynical student body, they have named their UNSW-based product **UNSW Streams** (or just **Streams** for short). **UNSW Streams** is the communication tool that allows you to share, communication, and collaborate to (attempt to) make streams a reality.

This project was inspired by Microsoft Teams
